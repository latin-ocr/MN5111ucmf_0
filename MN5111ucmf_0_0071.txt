chronicon rerum gestarum in monasterio S. Albani regnante Henrico Vl
(razn-31) in MS. Harl. 3775 (ed. Riley Amund. i. p. 1·69); John Amun-
desham or Amersham, the presumed writer of the annals of tlte twenty
years of John thethamstede¹s first abbacy (141140) 11 MS· Claudius
D.i (ed. Riley)·, and the great John Whethamstede himself (d. 1465),
undet whose name we have a register (Registrum abbatiae Joh. Whetham·
stede, MS. Amund. iii in Coll. os Arms, ed. Riley), extending over the
first ten years 11 his second abbncy [1452-62), but which is more probably
a compilation made alter his death irom two registers kept by him or
under his supervision, and 1 series ol letters (in MS. Claud. Ι), 11. 1-32)
written during his first abbacy, in a singularly verbose and prolix style
(ed. Riley). This register was succeeded by those 11 William Albon,
abbat 1465-76, and William Wallingiord‚ abbat 1476-84, which are
destitute othistorical details, and illustrate the state ol helpless decrepitude
and decadence into which the monastery had then fallen.

These, then, ate the chroniclers ot St. Albane, as at present known. lt
has been seen that there is a break in the histories from 1327 to 1376,
and in the names 11111 Henry tle illanciord to Tho. Walsingham or the
anonymous author oi the Chronicon Angliae; a break extending over the
whole reign ol Edward lll. To explain this fact, it has been assumed
that the annalists of St. Albane had tliecl out, either because the immense
superiority of Matthew Paris and his chief follower Matthew 11111111-
minster acted as a deterrent to others, or because the stream of
historiography had diverted into other channels, as in lligclen and Trivet,
and that a lew meagre continuations oi Matthew os Westminster ancl
Higden were all that helped to lill the vacuum caused by the deleasance
11 the older school ot annalists.

Now this conclusion was premature: the vacuum does not exist, the
series of writers is unbroken Tlte gap is exoclly covered ly Joltn ff
