text3 and this new author must also he held responsible 101 the other
alterations newiy introduced. This unknown author was a contemporary
of W. de Worde‚ and his new revision was no doubt made expressly
forits publication by print ¹.

These new lives have no Narrationes. They are most of thern complla-
tions from different sources in the ivise 01 John of Tynemouth, though
less ahridged. In Ursula the complete text 01 1110 Revelationes C. Her-
manni losephi can. reg. Steinfeldensis is given without abridging, followed
hy extracts from the Passio argi Legenda aurea; in Osmund the com-
plete text 01 the lessons in the Sarum Breviary. Joseph ab Arimathia is
an excerpt lrorn John of Glastonhury‚ but incompleta as the text sorne-
tirnes breaks off with ‘&c.’ ln the new lite 01 Riehard the end is made
up from the older text oi John 01 Tynemouth‚ and the Narratio is
retained.

ln addition to the ornissions reserable to Capgrave the Ed. omits
several passages which are still found in MS. Tanner: so the Statutes of
Clarendon in Thomas Beket‚ some passages in Brendan (pp. 142, 149,Ι
152), in Edward mart. (p. 350), Erkenwald (pp. 392, 398), Kentigern
(p. 122). Other alterations are rare. ln Godric the prologue (relating
how the life cameto he written) is transposed to the end (p. 497). 111
the Narratio 01 Cedwalla, given in John of Beverley‚ the epitaph in verse
has been added lronr Bede; in Patriek, p. 280, l. 35, a sentence inserted
(Et secundum opinionem modernorum S. Patricius et S. Benignus
discipulus suus iacent in uno scrinio ex australi parte summi altaris in
Glastonia’); in Gildas the last sentence replaced by another3 in Dubric
the first line (with the date) omitted. Sometimes, though very rarely,
the text has been interfered with: in Felix the last sentence ‘et veritas
inquisita innotuit' has been expanded to ‘Quesitus calumniator capitur, et
peceatum confitens suspendio iudicatur: sed Iohanne interveniente, mors
in exilium conuertebatur’3 111 Wistan 466, the reading ‘timebat enim
plebem' replaced by ‘ quod quidem non bene ausus luerat attemptare oh
plebis timorem’3 in Wlfhilde 507, Τ11)Δ reads ‘languorem simulat,¹ Ed.
‘gravi se corporis sui languore laborare sirnulat'3 in Guthlac, half a line
has been transposed; in Petroc, p. 317, the Ed. inserts alter ‘barbari'
‘christiane religionis penitus ignari' ; in Wilsrid, ii. 431, ⁴ Eboracensem’ ;
occasionally aword is added to relieve the sense (so ‘te decet' ii. 228,
1. 36, ‘et quod valuerit’ 1194, 120, ‘ipsa'ii 314, l. 31) ; ‘deuote’ ii. 314 15
changed to ‘deuotissimet’ Sometimes the beginning words are re-

² That it must have existed some time belore 1516. is proved hy the lact that in
the same year 1516 appeared an extract in English in Py'nson's press. The
English text could hardly have been made from W. de Worde‘s, and printed, in
the seme year. Whether W. de Worde's edition 01 1516 was preceded by an
earlier one we have no informatiou. The Prologue speaks 01 this present Legenda
as ‘iam noviter impressa'; these words do not necessarily imply that there was
an older edition; tf they do. the words themselves must have been inserted. The
editor of the English epitome (The Kalendre 01 the newe Legende 01 Englunde)
says efixpiessly (in the Trolog.) that ‘ it is but aflate lyme wille sayde Legende
lii 1111ἑῆ11111111111,11111111111111111111 seruam
