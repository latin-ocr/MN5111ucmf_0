The next is the Opus Chronicorum in MS. Claud. D. vi.f. 115, 1259—96
(ed. Rirey, Joh. de Trohelowe), the work 01 an anonymous author, who
wrote at the desire 01 abbat John (John Maryns, 1301-8). This, again, is
used hy the next known chronographer,William Rishanger (12501-1312 1),
who, by his own statement, was, on May 3, 1312, sixty-two years old,
and a 11101111 01 forty-one years¹ standing. But which of the three continua-

(125o97); andFaustina, B. ix (1259—1306 pthe basis of Riley's ed.)-is due
to him, is an open questiones even the earliest part was written after
1290, 111 latter partnot before 1327, when R. ean hardly have still been
alive (cf. Riley). Resides, he wrote a Narratio de Bellis apud Lewes et
Evesham (1258-167) in MS. Claud. D. vi, and Recapitulatio brevis 111
gestis Edwardi l in Reg. 14 C. i and Claud. D. vi (probably intended to
continue the Opus Chronicorum). The next known chronicler was
John de Trokelowe, formerly cellarer 01 Tynemouth, from 1295 monh of
81.111111,111111111111111111 Edwardi ΙΙ, 1307-22 (Μὸ. Claud.
D. vi, ed. Riley). His work was continued by Henry de Blancford,
whose ‘chronica’ follows immediately in the same MS„ extending from
1323 10 1324, where -it abruptly ends (the last leaves being lost).

After an interval of more than sixty years, which is at present not
accounted for, theseries of writers-is continued by Thomas Walsingham‚
praecentor and scriptoran'us under abbat Thomas de la Mare (who at
his suggestion erceted a new scriptorium), 1394, prior 01 Wymundham‚
whence he returned to St. Albans in 1400. He wrote (1) Historia Anglicana‚
in MS. Arund. 7 Coll. of Arms (ed. Riley)‚ 1272-1422‚ or more probably
only its earlier constituent 3 MS. Ar. being a compound 01 1110 chronicles
of St. Albans: 1. MS. Reg. 13 C. ix. f. 177—326 (wr. after 1394), 1272-
1392, with the exception of 1327-43 which in Ar. are given from pseudo-
Walter Hemingford (ed. Heame, ii) with occasional insertions from Reg,
2. MS. C. C. C. C. F, 1392-1422‚ the first leaf 01 which (tol. 25) was origin-
ally the last leaf of Reg. MS. Reg. again is the last link 01 1 chain of five
consecutive editions of the same chronicle: the earliest, MS. Otho C. ii
(injured by 1111), gives a contemporary history of 1376-9, also extant in
MS. Bodl. 316f. 150-1 and Harl. 3634 1. 137-163 (both being originally .
one MS.); the latter then continues the history from 1379 to 1382 in a
second but contemporary hand (f. 164-190), and adds 1382-8 in a some-
what later hand, which has also added the portion 1328-70 (omitting
1371-5), while MS. Bodlf. 152-175 (after the first two leaves of the text
removed to Harl) given, in one series and one hand, a complete chronicle
of 1313111111. 1371-5), as a new attempt3 of this, MS. Faustina B. in
(the MS. found at Tynemouth by Leland) gives only the latter part 1360-
883 MS. Reg. 13 C. ix gives the whole with many corrections, and adds
the continuation of 1388-91, and the pretiminary part 1272-1327 (ex-
tracted from Rishanger‚ Trokelowe, Blancford). Eodl. and Faust. repre-
