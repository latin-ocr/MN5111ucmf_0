main an ecclesiastical history, treating chiefly oi the saints oi the different
epochs-and would, of course, also occur in his Lectionarium.

It would be vain to attempt defining the chronology ot his works, as
most of them aretusa, and the Historia aurea is still in MS. awaiting the
editor; but it seems that he had several works in hand at one and
the same time. His industry‚ to judge srom the number os big volumes
he leit, must have been marvelious.

The Sanctilogium (MS. Tib. E. i) was certainly completed before the
middle of the sourteenth century. The Historia aurea breaks off rather
abruptly in the midst oi the siege ni Calais, June, 1347. The reason
suggests itseli that he was not leit to finish bis work. Thon, what more
likely than that he was swept away by the great plague oi 1348—9 ¹,
which, within a short time, took off more than sorty of the monks ot
Str Albans out of a total os about sixty-at which date he would be about
sixty years oi age? His lise would thus be fixed between 1290 and 1349².
There is other evidence to support this date. His latest Saint is Thomas
de la 11111, martyred at Dover, 1295, whose life, with the ί1111111111 post
transitum,’ must be of somewbat later date3 Thomas, bp. oi Hereiotd
(d. 1282), was canonized in 1320. He uses Trivet (1. 1260-1330h whose
Annales, about 1136 to 13ο7, and continued to 1318, are one os the chief
sources os the century (used also by Walsingham and MS. Reg. 13 C. ix).
He uses Higden, but only his first edition of 1327-not those os 1336,
1341, 1347, 1351. 111 uses the so·called Brompton, but sor this chronicle
no date can be given, except that it was made aster Higden‚ and is based
on a previous compilation made probably by a person connected with
Norwich. But 111 is used by Knighton ((1.1. 1366), the second aad third
books oi whose Chronicle are mostiy transcribed srorn John of Tyne-
mouth, and is known, though distantly, to hlurimuth (1274-1347), whose
Continuatio cronicarum extended to 1337 in its first e'dition, to 134711
the second, and to Robert of Avesbury, whose history ends in 1356.
