inituhtlttiun. xlvii

contemporary chronicle (Otho, dre.) is written in a spirit hostile to John ol
Gaunt (born 1340); in the later MSS. (Bou, which was written ior
Thomas of Woodstoclr, Dulre of Gloucester, younger brother oi John ol'
Gaunt) this hostility is toned down, and the corrector ot' Reg. eliminatos
the ofsensive phrases. The part comprising the years 1328-76 (the reign
oi Edward 111) rests on sources hitherto unascertained. The whole
chronicle oi 1328—88 has been ed. by E. Μ. Thompson, 1874 (from MS.
Harl. and Bodl.). Its history is a sair illustration ol how monastic annals
originate, which are rarely the production ol a single hand, but grow
up srom period to pen'od by the labourol different hands, each age adding
fresh materiale. Α contemporary part forms the nucleus ior retrospective
additions, while it is itsell swallowed up by subsequent ‘contemporaries'
and in its turn becomes past history.

MS. Corp. Chr. Coll. Cambr. 7, the source ol the later part ol MS.
Ar. 7, is a supplementary volume to the Historia aurea in C. C. C. C.
5 and 6, made up of the papers leit by Will. Wintershyll1 (d.c.1424),
who had the copy of the Hist. aurea made at his erpense. The loose
sheets so leit were bound together in their present form by Robert
Ware, bursar of St. Albans alter Wintershyll. As Wintershyll was a
man oi great learning, these sheets may have been his own composition,
or compiled under his supervision. The MS. contains three (not five as
Nasmith’s Catal. has it) distinct historical works; the first a history of
1377-1405.011vr· 1-28.43. 44. ³1. 32. 71. 72. 101-4. 89. 90. 41. 42. 29. 30.
45-8 of the present vol. ; the second—which is the continuation ot'Reg.-
a chronicle ol 1392—1406, on pp. 49-70, 73-88, 91-100, 33-40, roy-1363
the third, oi 1392-1422, on pp. 137-182 ², the earlier part being lost. The
first and third are condensations ol, or abstracts from, the second, between
1392 and 1406. The compiler os MS. Ar, however, not perceiving that
the second was the right continuation oi MS. Reg. (whose last leat is the
first of this text) adopted the text oi No. 3 and 1 (from which No. 3 was
immediately compiled), taking no notice ol No. 2, the¹ original orthem
both.

Thomas Walsingham further wrote: (2) Gesta Abbatum S. Albani, MS.
Claud. E. iv (ed. Riley), a compilation os the last ten years os the souneenth
century, the first section of which, down to 1255, is derived from Matthew
Paris, the second, ending with the death of abbat John Maryns in 1308,

Walsingham apud S. Albanum poterit reperire'·-and these details are sound in
MS. Reg.; but ns this MS. is younger thnn Bodl. (written soon aster 1388), the
original MS. ol the ‘ Greater Chronicle' must lie further hook. Riley holds MS.
Reg: to be Walsingham's work, und the corrections in it to be in his own hand·

¹ So a note on the first page hns it: 'Hunc librum cronicnlem tarn gestorum
regum qnam ahbatum, post mortem Dompni Willelmi Wyntershylle in quaternis
derelictum, connecti lecit Dominus Robertus Ware; et licet diversae materiei
diversa sunt, propter defectus quaternorum, non consonantia, studeat tamen lector
litores? rtnellilluos et coloribus amaricatos, prout tempora luerunt, degustare, timere
