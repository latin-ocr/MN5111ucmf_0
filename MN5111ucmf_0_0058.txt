xxxa 111000 tentata analio.

de Whetely is named as vicar of the church 01 Tynemoutu It appears,
therefore, that our auth0r¹s vicarship had expired in 1325, and that he
filled that post from 1315 to ab. 1325.

From these facts we 111111 start. As twenty-five was the canonical age
for receiving priesthood, we may deduce that he was born ab. 1290. His
date, therefore, is earlier than is generally supposed, and nearly coincides
with the great revival of thought aud literature in the North, as repre-
sented by Duns scotus (1274 ?—1308) and Richard Rolle (13001-13491).

Α1 vicar he was closely connected with the priory of Tyneurouth3
and there is reason to believe that, or vicar, Ire was metator of tlte
frolernity1 and their deputy for the parish, and that so he was a
Benedictine monlr from the outset, and long before his settlement at
St. Albane. These vicarages had sprung up during the reign of the
three Edwards, whose policy it was to enforce the power of the State
00 the elergy and to curb the civil power of the Pope. ”

Ι read in Newcome, Hist. of St Albans, 1793, p. 233, that ‘it was a
very politic act 01 Edward III to institute vicarages, and thus encourage a
laborious parochial clergy, endowing the same out of the swoln possession
of the regulars ι 101, though it was impracticable to deprive these bodies
of laniis or of tithes by force, yet they would consent to endow a vicar,
and provide for his residence, on condition lte war ono os their body;
but, 00 other terms, or 10 suffer the patronage to pass from thenr, they
still refused? The case was similar at Redburu, where the vicarage
house was also the residence of the monkst (Nervcome, p. 218).

So, then, we may construe his earlier life thus: that he was bornat
Tynemouth ab. 1290, probably of low parentage-as his only name is
John 01 Τ. simply, without a surnanre3 that, being a clear-headed,
studious boy of sonre promise, he was taken in hand by the convent,
educated in their house, and early entered the brotherhood3 that he was

King or of others, if licente were granted to John de ereteley, Vicar 011110

yearly, and were further worth ²3³· And that there remained to the aforesaid
John beyond this gift seven messuages and eight oxgangs of land in Estchirton,
worth yearly 1001, holden of the said Prior and Convent by the service of one

incident thereto’ (Gibson, i. 153). A list of the viears and priests of T, in more
recent times, since 1492, is given by Gibson, ii. p. clxxii.

¹ Ihave made inquiries on ibis point, and find a certain unwillinguess to allow
the identity of monlr and vicar in 1110111110 person, but the fact seems undeuiable.

² John 01 T. was not, then, as Pits has it, ‘ vicarius sub pastore loci,' but under
the prior, and probably 0 monh himself. The vicar always appears with the
officials of the priory, and is named in one breatlr with other monhs; bis church
was that of the priory, aud stood within its precincts. Du (lange says 1. v.
Vicarius: ‘Sic appellabantur, abAuglis praesentaverint perpetui qui in Ecclesiis
constituuntur quae Monasteriis aut Collegiis Canonicorum appropriatae sunt, i. 0.
quae ad Monasteria 1111 Collegia Canonicorum pertinent.'
