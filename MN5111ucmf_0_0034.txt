st. Albans3 aud if we consider its date and supreme correctness it must
have been one of the first MSS. of our Collection, ii not the original iteelf,
made in the Scriptorium of the abbey under the direction ot John of
Tynemouth, then chronographer oi St Albans. From the above inscrip-
tion the conclusion has been made (by BishopNicholson; Gibson ¹, Hist.
oi Tynemouth, 1846, ii. 5 3) that the MS. was dedicated to Abbat Thomas
hythe author, and that the work was undertaken or written at the
abhat’s suggestion: but nothing in the words of the passage justifies this
construction, indeed, it will presently be seen that the work most
probably belongs to a time anterior to Abbat Thomas.

The fite has irremediably damaged the tirst leaves of the MS, and
generally caten round the corners, affecting the exterior column and the
first lines of each page, which are often illegible to the naked eye, while
the interior columns are generally readable. i have tried, wherever
possible, to restore the text, partly by consulting the original sources, =
partly with the help of chemicals‚ which the authorities of the British
Museum were kind enough to employ at my petition sor the clearet
bringing out of certain passages-which kindness it is my agreeable
duty here publicly to acknowledge.

The MS. contains 156 lives, alter which follows a prolix, incomplete
life of St. Christina (a Saint connected with St. Albans) ², which, though
· written by the same hand, seems to he a subsequent addition. The collec-
tion includes St. Patrick’s Purgatory and Tundal, which were omitted in
the later stages oi the collecti0n3 has different texts for SS. Richard and
Utsula, and many more Narrationes than MS. Tanncr and the edition; lt
alone gives, under the texis, the antiphones and cellects for the Saints’
days (collected from the Sarum and other Breviaries). SS. Margaret and
Oswin have genealogies appended on the margin. A prologue is wanting.

¹ ‘We may fairly presume that, among the many famous persons with whom
Abbat Thomas became connected from his reputation ancl iuiiuence in tlre public
affairs oi his time, there were none whose iriendship the good abbat vnlned more
highly thau that oi John oi Tynemouth. This reverend historian dedicated to
Ahbut Thomas de la Mare that great work—the Sanctiloglum Britanniae-which
has rendered his name imperishable, a dedication which forms a tribute to tlte
abbat’s character, a testimony to the friendship of these great men, and an
argument ior supposing that the work was undertaken or written nt the abbat’s
