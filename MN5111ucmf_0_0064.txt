to the priorate about 1339, and, alter him, Thomas de la Mare, in 1341.
Η1 was the second son 01 Sir John de la Mare and Johanna, daughter 01
Sir John de Harpsfield, and was born about 1308. The family was settled
in Herts. His father's brother was abbat 01 Missenden3 Richard, his own
elder brother, was an Augustine monk at Thetford; John, his other
- brother, took the monastic vow at St. Albans, and their only sister was a
nun of De la Pre, a cell 01 st. Albans3 probably, he was also related to
the noble Alicia de la Mare, abbess of St. Mary’s atWinchester(Gibson).
He had served his probation in the cell of Wymundham, had been
professed in 1326, appointed steward 0151. Albans in 1335, and cellarer in
1336. He was cheerful, meek and humble in spirit, benign, genereus,
hospkable, a lover of peace, a patron 01 learning, an encourager of merit3
ageneral favourite; of dignified presence, and fluent speech. As prior
01 Tynemonth, he was first employed in cumbating the enemies 01 the
convent, next in restoring its prosperous state and repairing its buildings
(01 which he spent 1864), and, withal‚ in extending the Kingdom of
God. In 1346, when King David invaded England‚ the Scottish leader,
Douglas, sent a message commanding the prior to prepare entertaimnent
101 him and his 111111011110110111151011110 days, He came-but as
aprisoner. A great nuisance at this time was a neighbour, Sir Gerard
de Widdrington, who unscrupulously claimed the manor 01 Hawkesley,
and, not content with going to law, kept the monks in constant sear
of assassination. ln this conflict Thomas was assisted by Lady Mary
de Percy, sister 01 Henry, Duke 01 Lancaster, who not only gave her
jevels to enable him to maintain his right, but also sent to his aid
Ι a mighty 1110111101, Sir Thomas Colvin, on whose appearing in court‘on
the day 01 the trial, and offering to maintain the prior's right by fight, Sir
Gerard withdrew his suit. 11 his time of peace the prior devoted himself
to peacesul study and to preaching the word 01 God; in perfonning this
duty he, contrary to custom, employed to accompany and to aid him
many secular clergyrnen and friars. In his convent he entorced the
rule, and enjoined piety. He seems 10 represent the influente 01 the new
zeal vawakened by Richard Rolle. ln 1349, when the great pest (the
Black Death) had cut off the lives 01 the abbat 01 St. Albans, Michacl de
Mentmore, 01 the prior, the sub-prior, and more than forty monks 01 the
abbey, so that the surviving brethren knew not how to fill the vacancies,
Thomas de la Mare was elected abbat, and invested at Avignon by the
Pope. As abbat he continued the work 01 reform, an able administrator, .
a patron 01 learning, a friend 01 the king, and died in 1396. ln the
priorate he was succeeded by Clement 01 Whethamstede‚ a monk of
St. Albans, and he by John, uncle 01 John 01 Whethamstede, after whom
followed, in 1396, John 01 Whethamstede‚ junior, who, in 1420, became
abbat¹.
