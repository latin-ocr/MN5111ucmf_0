axvi tuoto titutum anulio.

Of Scotch Saints we find Ninian (of Whithern) Kentigern (of Glasgow),
Columba, and, of later time, Margareta Regina¹ (d. 1093).

The lrish Saints are less complete; we find represented Patriclr‚
Benignus, Indractus (these also connected with Glastonbury), Erigida,
Piran or Kiaran (of Saighlr), Finan (oi Mobile), Brendan, Aiduus‚
Columba, Modwena, andos Irish missionaries² Columban, Fnrseus and
his brother Fohlan, Fiacrius, Maxentiali), Osmanna3 the Ed. adds Kilian
and Wyro⁵. The great collectione os Irish Saints, the Liber Kilkenniensis
(or Codex Ardmachanus) and MS. Dublin Trin. Coll. E. 3. 11, MSS.
Rawl. 485 and 505, and several MSS. in the Bibl. Duc. Burgundiae near
Brussels (Cod. Salmatieensis, and Vol. xi, besides a collection in Irish
in Vol. iv) are all of subsequent date.

Of the English Saints, Audoenus (St. Ouen) hardly deservee a place -
in the Collection, and can rest his claim only on some bones shown at
Canterbury, and their translation as described by Eadmer-but with the
same right St. Andrew the apostle might have been admitted, with more
right Gregory the Great (of whom relies were also shown at Canterbury),
or Germanus and Lupus, who visited Englnnd to defend the saith against
Pelagianism. The first bishops were ltalians, as also Lanfrane, Anselm;
Theodorus was a Greek; Adrian an African ; lvo a Pasiam loseph ab
Arimathia a Jerusalemitan3 hidan a Celt; Henry the bennit a Dane.

Some Salnts are omitted in the lives‚but occur among the Narrationes, .
as Erhengoda, Alcuin, Herebertus puer, Walleuus comes (see above).
Some additional lives are given in MS. Bodl. 240 (a collection made at
Bury St. Edmund's, which contains lives from John of Tynemouth and
other authors), viz. St. Horra, Brithnod, Eadnod, Ailwin ep. Elmamensis
(these from the Hist. Ellensis), Iurminus (from a Bury St. Edmund’s
MS.); these lives l have given in an Appendh, ii. p. 538ff.-'

Of early British Saints the Collection contains Mello (first bp. of Rouen,
dc. 280), Alban (the Protomartyr of Britain), and Amphibalus (both
martyred at St. Albans, 304) ; the Ed. adds Ioseph ab Arimathia (patron
ol Glastonbury3 nom loh. Glaston.) and Helena. The A. S. church⁴ is
represented by the first bishops of Canterbury: Lethard (who accom- “
panied Bertha of Franco on her marriage with Ethelbert of Kent)‚
Augustin (who lauded in the isle of Thanet in 5973 first bp. of Canterbury,
597-605), Laurentius (fios—19), Mellitus (oro-24), lustus (624-7), Honorius
(627-53), Deusdedit (653-64), Theodorus (668-9o)‚ then Bregwi'n (759-
