Rollo to 1419, dedicated to Henry V, hy way of compliment sor his recent

So Tho. Walsingham was preceded bythe unknown author-or authors
—of the Chronicon Angliae¹ of 1328-88, which was cominenced aster
1376, and followed by the author of the chronicle in C. C. C. C. 7, made
under the auspices of Will. Wintershyll. ’

This Will. Wintershyll (or Wintershull, C. C. C. C. 5) must certainly be
ranhed among the writers of St. Albans. He figures prominently in the
annals ol the abbey. He was for many years elemosinarius Monasterii
(‘ ad quern tutela manerii pertinebat ²), chaplain and cross-bearer of four
succeeding abbats [Thomas de la Mare, John Moote 1391-1401, Will.
Heyworth 1401-10, and John Whethamstede 111040), once—at Moote’s
death-candidate for the abbacy l‘habebat 5 vota ¹). In MS. Harl. 377 5,
written ab. 1429, he is mentioned as ‘nabar multo tempore elemosinarius,'
and was then dead : he must have lived between 1350 and 1424. He was
a great benefactor of the abbey, erected several altars, contributed to
beautisying the chnrch (Amund. i. 148-9), provided 1 Missal lor the
chapel of St. Stephen’s [Amund. i. 450: ‘Item unurn Missnle antiquum,
quod quondam deserviebat in Capella S. Stephani curn quaternis novis,
sumptibus eiusdem Willelmo eidem annexis ’). He made 10115 of bene·
factors and an inventory (ib. i. 448: ‘ut in Rutulis Benefactorum eiusdem,
et Inventorio seu Memorandorio eiusdem, plenius apparet¹), and not im·
probably wrote the report on the dispute regarding precedence between
the abbats of St. Albans and Westminster in 1397, in MS. Harl. 3775 (ed.
Riley‚ Amund. i. 414), He it was who ‘lecit conscribi ¹ (MSS. C. C. C. C.

clearly distinguishes.between the two; he says, ‘Anno 1388 claruit quidam
monachus ut apparet S. Albani innominatus, cuius extat Historia ab 1530 ad
